# VIO

This Python script "massages" a raw VIO file we receive from IHS. The output .csv file created connects to our catalog based on a unique ID, which concatenates 'Base Vehicle ID' + 'Liters' + 'Drive Type' + 'Transmission Speed'. We will be using these output files to report on the capture rate of our catalog in Power BI.
